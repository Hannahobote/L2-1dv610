## Chapter 2, meaningful names
 This chapter has really affected me, because before I didn't take into account following the rule about **"intention revealing names"**, or **make meaningful distinctions**. I usually had many variables with the same or similar names, but did completely different things, and this was confusing for both for me and the teacher. I think these two rules go hand in hand. I usually had conflict between **readability** and **understandability**, when I tried to have **intention revealing names**, because it led to long detailed function names, however, it was not readable according to the **readability** perspective.

 ## Chapter 3, Functions
The rules in this chapter were one of the hardest to implement, becuase Iâ€™m so used to having nested if statements upon if statements . It was really hard keeping the code **small** and have it **do one thing**. What helped my my functions to be **small** and only **do one thing** is the fact that i **used descriptive names**. This forces me to stick to the name. If I promised a function should so a certain task, then it should only do that. I also tried to make my code as **dry** as possible by using the mvc pattern. Overall I agree with everything in this chapter . I also have a lot of **dyadic** and **triad function arguments**, which is still a problem i am dealing with.
